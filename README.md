# Async Week Project

Hello, and welcome to my Async Week Project! My focus this week (both in boilermaker and here) was to try to build a dynamic chart showing various types of data from either the Star Wars or Star Trek universe(s). Unfortunately, I fell quite short of that. If you watch the page, however, I do plan to continue working on it and reach my goal even after the project is due! Updates will still be pushed to Heroku post-submission.

Thanks for taking a look! Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

## Technologies explored

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/)
- [Vega](https://vega.github.io/vega/) and [Vega-lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/)
- [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com)
- [d3js](https://d3js.org/) (not currently implemented in page)
- Data retrieval from public API's (specifically swapi.dev and stapi.co)
- CSS in JS - Planned, not finished.
